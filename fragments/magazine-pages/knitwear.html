    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Classic Comfort: Men's Stylish Sweaters</p>
<p class="hm-magazine-description-dp"><a href="/en/shop-men/shop-product/cardigans-jumpers/">Stylish knitwear</a> is at the top of everyone's wishlist right now, and for good reason. <a href="/en/shop-men/shop-product/cardigans-jumpers/">Knitted sweaters</a> are essential in every man's wardrobe. They're timeless all-round staples that can be dressed up or down in endless ways, available in many fits and fabrics: from classic cotton to soft cashmere, luxe mohair, and fine merino wool. Investing in long-lasting premium knitwear, such as this season's fine-knit cashmere jumper with a slightly fitted silhouette, is always a wise choice.</p>
<p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">When vibing for knitwear, a plain-knit jumper, rib-knit jumper, or cable-knit sweater looks just as good layered over a crisp t-shirt as it does teamed with a classic cotton shirt or a checked flannel shirt. Simply add a pair of tailored trousers or relaxed-fit jeans in deep indigo or savvy black, and you're good to go. For a more sophisticated appearance, combine a crewneck or v-neck sweater with a sharp shirt and stylish autumn slacks. For the full look, consider a blouson jacket, an unlined blazer or a bomber on top. Finish the ensemble with fresh white trainers or polished Derby shoes.</p>
<p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Effortless Style: Men's Half-Zip Sweaters</p>
<p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Make way for the half-zip sweater. This standout knitwear staple is an essential layering piece that promises all-season sharpness. Pair it with slacks or chinos and nubuck Chelsea boots to master the sleek Sunday brunch look. Or opt for straight-fit indigo jeans and trainers to achieve an effortless everyday ensemble.</p>

    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Sophisticated Silhouettes: Men's Sleek Turtlenecks</p>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Uplevel your knitwear wardrobe with a classic turtleneck jumper. Timeless, wearable, and stylish, it ensures sharp looks no matter the occasion. A super-soft cashmere rollneck sweater effortlessly captures the luxe minimalist aesthetic. Meanwhile, a monochromatic all-black turtleneck and tailored trousers combo exudes timeless elegance. You can also tuck your turtleneck into a pair of belted indigo jeans, or achieve an impeccably sleek and noble look with slacks and a blazer. To embrace a grungy '90s vibe, layer your rollneck under a chunky oversized cardigan, or consider adding a voluminous bomber or puffer jacket for an expressive silhouette.</p>

   <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Versatile Layers: Men's Contemporary Cardigans</p>
   <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">The knitted cardigan has made a stylish comeback as a modern must-have. As a highly versatile layering piece, it seamlessly transitions between seasons and provides the prefect frame for your favourite T-shirts and button-up shirts. If you're looking to boast your autumn knitwear wardrobe, consider a fashion-forward cardigan in chunky wool or with a cable-knit structure, coming in the season's earthy nuances and fresh colourways. Alternatively, you can opt for a fine-knit cardigan styled over a crewneck sweater or a knitted polo shirt. Both zip-up cardigans and slouchy oversized cardigans are easily paired with a variety of trousers, from iconic denim jeans to preppy slacks, fancy joggers, and tailored chinos. For a contemporary city vibe, team them with streetwise cargo trousers and high-top trainers.</p>
   <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Modern Prep: Men's Popover Polo Shirts</p>
   <p class="">Elevate your ensemble with a standout polo shirt in an earthy autumn tone. The polo shirt is the ultimate smart-casual piece, exuding a preppy aesthetic with a modern retro vibe. Consider the short-sleeve polo shirt, or opt for the long-sleeve rib-knit popover polo shirt for a next-level look. Pair it with chinos, the ideal styling partner to pull off this look, and add a sharp wool coat or trench coat along with Chelsea boots.</p>
