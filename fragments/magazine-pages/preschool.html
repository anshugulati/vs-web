    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Nail preschool prep with a well-selected wardrobe that covers all your bases. Opt for garments that are easy to match when mornings are hectic, easy to change for you and preschool caregivers, and easy to move in for all-day play. Our Back to Preschool destination is carefully curated with baby and toddler outfits for every eventuality and taste — here are the highlights:</p>
    <h2 class="hm-magazine-h2">Seasonal trends for toddlers</h2>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Inspirational toddlerwear and practical garments are not mutually exclusive. This year, we bring a campus-inspired collection that won’t restrict play, like easy T-shirts, comfy crew necks and functional jeans with adjustable waists.</p>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Smarter pieces feature fun details for toddlers: refined blouses meet bow details, tulle skirts bring sensory style, while animal prints and soft teddy backpacks make getting ready an enjoyable experience.</p>

    <h2 class="hm-magazine-h2">Baby denim: the foundations</h2>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">This faithful wardrobe staple doesn’t need to be predictable — especially for little ones. Our updated denim range features elevated details that enhance the classic jacket or jeans, like detailed collars, pleats and heart-shaped pockets. Dungarees are surprisingly easy to put on or take off with button poppers that allow swift nappy changes, while jeans with adjustable waists keep sizing flexible.</p>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">With various tops and bottoms in a range of blue washes to choose from, versatile denim is a solid base for your toddler’s outfit.</p>
    <h2 class="hm-magazine-h2">Easy essentials</h2>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Simple bodysuits in neutral colours are not only ideal back-ups for inevitable stains but they’re endlessly comfy and easy to style. You can also find matching leggings in cute prints from bows to dogs to stripes — whichever your little one prefers.</p>

    <h2 class="hm-magazine-h2">Layers and outerwear</h2>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">This year, our transitional collection focuses on quilted and shell jackets, neutral beanies and trainers — all ideal for medium temperatures. Rain trousers, functional boots and mittens are good to have on standby and layers are always your friend; fleeces, cardigans, leggings and knitted tops are easy to add or remove in tune with your child’s activity, and they don’t get too hot beneath outer layers.</p>

    <h2 class="hm-magazine-h2">Toddler shoes and accessories</h2>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Our slip-on ballerina pumps are sweet and convenient, while easy-fasten trainers are a strong option for independent toddlers. Chelsea boots bring classic style when thicker footwear is required and our trusty rain boots come in fun floral and leopard prints, along with neutrals.</p>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">When it comes to accessories, a weather-appropriate hat and backpack are both fun and functional outfit finishers. This year, we’re big on berets and beanies, while the ever-charming teddy fleece backpack is a guaranteed hit.</p>
    <p class="hm-magazine-description-dp">Ensure your child is comfortable and suitably dressed in a well-curated wardrobe from our Back to Preschool destination. To extend the life of the garments, wash them at as low temperatures as the stains allow and share them with siblings, friends, or donation centres when outgrown. And after all the effort you put into choosing and caring for these preschool pieces, just remember to label the clothes so they find their way home.</p>
